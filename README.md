# fsf_calibrator tool

Q = v.A

Fg = Ag / A
Fo = Ao / A
Fw = Aw /A

Fg + Fo + Fw = 1

As we have bulk velocity from sonar we known the total flow rate and velocity, 

next we uses Bernoulli's principle and the conservation laws

Ap = (rho * V) /2 * ((A1/A2)^2) -1 )

then using different models you can calculate the GVF

In this case, we'll find a way to get an approach of the needed density to reach a reference measurement
